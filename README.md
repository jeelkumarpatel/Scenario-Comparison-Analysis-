**Project Title:** Comprehensive Analysis of Global COVID-19 Data

**Project Description:**

**Objective:**
The project aimed to perform an extensive analysis of global COVID-19 data from the source provided at https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. 
This analysis involved data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to derive meaningful insights regarding the pandemic's impact across different regions and time frames.

**Data Sources:**
The primary data source for this project was the COVID-19 dataset obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.

**Data Cleaning:**
1. The initial data cleaning phase was conducted using Microsoft Excel, where the data was segregated into two major categories: "CovidDeaths" and "CovidVaccinations."
2. Unwanted and redundant data were removed during this phase.
3. Basic statistical analyses were performed to better understand the data.

**SQL Data Exploration:**
The project primarily utilized SQL for in-depth data exploration and analysis. The dataset was transformed into a structured database format. Key activities included:
- Data exploration of the global COVID-19 dataset, which encompasses a multitude of features.
- Development of multiple views to facilitate comparisons of COVID-19 situations across continents, countries, and cities.
- Exploration of data for various time ranges to capture the evolving nature of the pandemic.
- Implementation of statistical analysis concepts to generate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that provide insights into different aspects of the COVID-19 situation across different geographic locations.

**SQL Techniques and Skills Employed:**
- Utilization of various SQL techniques, including joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, and window functions.
- Implementation of aggregate functions to summarize and analyze data.
- Creation of database views to simplify complex queries and facilitate reporting.
- Conversion of data types to ensure compatibility and accuracy of analysis.

**Toolset:**
- MySQL Workbench was initially employed for data exploration.
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) was used for the remainder of the project to gain proficiency with SSMS and leverage its advanced capabilities.

**Data Visualization:**
To enhance data comprehension and facilitate decision-making, a basic dashboard was created to showcase vital insights derived from the global COVID-19 dataset.

**Conclusion:**
This project involved a comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 data, leveraging SQL techniques and data visualization to extract valuable insights. 
The exploration encompassed various geographical locations and different time frames, resulting in the generation of KPIs to aid in the understanding of diverse aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact. 
This project not only involved data analysis but also served as a learning opportunity for the proficient use of SQL tools and techniques for real-world applications.
